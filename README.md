CrowdfundingERD.png shows the ERD that was created to generate crowdfunding_db_schema.sql, the database schema.
The schema was directly generated by QuickDBD from the ERD we created on it.
Included are screenshots of the SELECT query being used on each of the database tables (SELECTcontacts.png,SELECTcategory.png, etc).
Additionally, the resulting ERD of the database in pgadmin is included for reference as crowdfunding_db.pgerd.
